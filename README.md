## Summary of Findings

- Majority of the loans are the current loans which are the ones that have not yet reached their due date and most of these belong to the employed borrowers.
-The Monthly Income of most of the borrowers is between 1000-8000.
-The higher the monthly income of an individual the higher the loans given.
-There's a linear relationship between Monthly Income and Monthly Loan payments. The monthly loan payments depend on an individual's Monthly Income.
-One unexepcted relationship is that borrowers with smaller loans pay more monthly loan payments compared to the ones with larger loans.
-The higher the original loans given , the higher the gross pre-chargeoff payments(LP- Customer Payments)
-Majority of the homeowners are borrowers who have jobs(Employed/Full-time)
-A surprising relationship is the one where the borrowers who are unemployed having higher credit scores compared to the ones with jobs.
-Borrowers who are due on their loan payments, mostly 1-15 days due, pay more monthly loan payments as compared to the ones whose loans are charged-off.
-Most of the defaulted loans belong to the borrowers who are retired.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on on how the loans given depend on the individuals' Monthly Incomes and how the Monthly Incomes affect the Monthly Loan Payments. Later I show the loan statuses of different categories of individuals based on the employment status. 
Finally I'll show how all these variables relate to each other.
